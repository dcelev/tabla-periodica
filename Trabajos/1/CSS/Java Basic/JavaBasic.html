            <p class="textop">JavaScript Basics JavaSmipt is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. JavaSmipt is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to lake it in
                a bunch of different directions. SavaScript lives inside a host environment (a web browser or Node saver), it can he comusted to the objects of these airdrome. to provide mogrammatic control over </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="#">Variable Declaration</a>JavaScript variables containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, cup holds coffee, a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be widi unique names. These
                        unique nanws aæ called identifiers .<samp>var x;</samp></li>
                    <li>Variable Assignment Assignment assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable.<samp>var x = 10;</samp></li>
                    <li><a href="#">Data types</a>aæ an important concept; to be able operu on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean - uue or false; null - null aka nothing; Number - 42 or 3.14159; String -
                        "Coding Dojo Rocks!" ; Array -<samp>[1 , 'Coding' , 2, 'Dojo']; and Object - {first_name: 'Jane', last_name: 'Doe'}</samp></li>
                    <li>When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your to accomplish ülis. There are
                        die following conditional statements: if a specified condition is true, do this in our block; else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; else we exwute this block of code;</li>
                    <li>Loops There many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action sonw number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the four ti_nrs
                        and then you stop. Ihats a loop!</li>
                    <li><a href="#">Functions</a> are an encaspulation of a block. When we call our function this will nm that code Think of it as a list of insüuctions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction
                        manual and get started, first we scæw legs to the table top; next we place die table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly tiere are a ton moæ tables to do so lets call our function over and over and over
                        again.
